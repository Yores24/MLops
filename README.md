# Customer Satisfaction Prediction MLOps Project

This repository showcases an end-to-end MLOps project for predicting customer satisfaction. The project leverages **ZenML** and **MLflow** for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle. It includes a **Streamlit** app for making predictions and monitoring model performance with metrics like the R² score.

## Features

- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Built with ZenML for modular, reproducible pipelines.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logs experiments, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks real-time R² scores and other metrics.
- **Automated Workflows**: Streamlined processes from data ingestion to model deployment.
